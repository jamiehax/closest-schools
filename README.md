Algorithm to find the two closest points (2D) from a set in O(nlogn)

Recursive divid and conquer algorithm to find the two closest 2D points from a set in O(nlogn) time. This is implemented on the Vermont public school system through open access data available on http://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/vt-school-locations-k-12. 

The algorithm is from my Algorithms and Complexity class, and some started code and the School class were written by my Professor, Shelby Kimmell.
