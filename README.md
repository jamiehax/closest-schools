Algorithm to find the two closest points (2D) from a set in O(nlogn)

Recursive divide and conquer algorithm to find the two closest 2D points from a set in O(nlogn) time. This is implemented on the Vermont public school system (through open access data available on http://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/vt-school-locations-k-12) to find the two closest public schools in Vermont. 

The algorithm is from my Algorithms and Complexity class, and some started code and the School class were written by my Professor, Shelby Kimmell.
